cTAKES Parser Utilities
========================
This repository contains default [Apache Tika](http://tika.apache.org/)
configuration for integrating the [Apache cTAKES](http://ctakes.apache.org/)
clinical text and knowledge environment. A tika-config is provided that 
enables the cTAKES parser and maps it to PDF and IsaTab documents. A
cTAKESParser.properties file is included that configures various properties
about how cTAKES is run and that stores login credentials for the Unified
Medical Language System (UMLS) which cTAKES requires.

Sample IsaTab data from 
[FP001RO-all-samples.txt](https://gist.github.com/5a56f8815bbb7374fddd/download)
is also included.
